The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing us to create different representations of the same object.

The Builder Pattern consists of the following components:

Product: The object that is being built.
Builder: An interface that defines the steps required to build the product.
Concrete Builder: A class that implements the builder interface and provides methods to construct and return the product.
Director: An optional class that defines the order in which the builder methods are called, and can simplify the client code.
